# Crude-NN
## Introduction
- It's a neural network library implemented from scatch, and most of them is basic components for building a complete model. Starts from layers by layers, for example, convolution layer and fully connected layer, and fuctions by fuctions, for example, relu , pooling , and sigmoid.
- I will use the functions I made to build the deep learning model for several basic task to prove my library is work, such as mnist classification, cifar-10 classficaion and etc. You can see more in "Case/Application" section.
- After I can build the model with my library, I will try to do some visulize and anaylisis, like show the loss curve ,calculate time and space complexity. You can see more in "Visualize" & "Analyze" sections.
- We hope in the future this library is not only for single machine, but also surport distributed system.  
- Although it only supports python now, and hope more in the future
