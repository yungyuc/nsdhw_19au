Term project and presentation guideline
=======================================

Everyone should submit a presentation application with homework assignment #5.
The format is

* Full name:
* English full name:
* Preferred time slots (at least 1, at most 2; use the ID listed below):
* Project subject:
* Public GitHub repository URL:

The term project is required to be in a public GitHub repository.  If you do not
have one or failed to provide one in the homework assignment #5, the grade of
your term project will be solely determined by your final presentation, by the
most strict professional standard.

Once you submit the GitHub repository, you can tag me (@yungyuc) in your issue
or PR.  I will also find time to review your code and file issues or PRs.

Presentation
============

Each presentation can use at most 16 minutes.  It is suggested that the
presentation itself uses 13-14 minutes and 2-3 minutes are left for questions
and discussions.  But a presenter has the full power to decide how to use his
time.

Presenter may use his own computer for presenting.  The time for setting up the
computer is included in the allotted presentation time.  To save setup time the
only accepted video connector is HDMI.

Presenter may also ask to use the instructor’s computer to present.  In this
case, the only accepted file format is PDF, and the file has to arrive the
instructor’s email box no later than 12/27.
